# Personal-Site
My portfolio of work experience and projects.

This was my first portfolio site, which was built with Gatsby.

After improving my front and backend skills, I no longer felt this project represented my skills as I developer and started the project over using Next.JS for static site generation and Strapi as a headless CMS.

The updated portfolio can still be found at https://trevordebard.com. Code is available in the [personal-site-frontend](https://github.com/trevordebard/personal-site-frontend) and [personal-site-backed](https://github.com/trevordebard/personal-site-backend) repositories.
